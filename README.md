## ‚≠ê Overview (STAR Method)

### **Situation**
As a participant in open-source competitions and project exhibitions (EPICS, university projects), I often struggled to deeply understand large codebases‚Äîespecially when onboarding new repositories from group members or exploring unfamiliar open-source projects. Sifting through thousands of files, dependencies, and scattered documentation was **tedious and overwhelming**, making it hard to answer even basic questions like "Where is X implemented?" or "How does this module work?"

### **Task**
I needed a platform that would let me:
- Instantly chat with any GitHub repo to ask questions about code, architecture, or logic.
- Quickly visualize and explore repo structure, file contents, and metadata.
- Perform semantic code search (not just by filename/text).
- Support multiple users and projects securely for my team and in competitions.

### **Action**
I independently designed and built **gitRAG**‚Äîan end-to-end, multi-tenant platform that ingests any public GitHub repo, chunks and indexes its code using embeddings and vector search, and enables users to interactively chat, search, and analyse codebases using a modern LLM (via LangChain and OpenAI API).

- **Built secure, scalable backend** using FastAPI, PostgreSQL (Aiven), PineconeDB, and LangChain.
- **Developed a modern React frontend** with hierarchical file explorer, real-time AI chat, and repo analytics.
- **Integrated Google/GitHub OAuth2** for authentication, and per-user encrypted API key management for privacy.
- **Engineered ingestion pipelines** to chunk, embed, and index 50MB+ codebases with 10,000+ files.
- **Tested and deployed** the platform on multiple real-world repos for open-source events and university project groups.

### **Result**
- Significantly reduced onboarding time for new repositories‚Äînow get context, explanations, and code Q&A in seconds.
- Enabled my team and myself to confidently tackle larger, more complex projects in hackathons and coursework.
- gitRAG is now a robust, reusable tool for anyone needing rapid understanding of unfamiliar codebases.

## ‚ö° How it Works (RAG Pipeline)

1. **Login** with Google or GitHub OAuth2 (secure, per-user).
2. **Paste any public GitHub repo URL** and your OpenAI API key (encrypted).
3. **Ingestion:**  
   - Fetches repo files via GitHub API
   - Chunks code using custom logic (by file type/size)
   - Generates vector embeddings (LangChain + OpenAI API)
   - Stores chunks and metadata in PineconeDB and PostgreSQL
4. **Analysis & Chat:**  
   - Use AI chat to ask any question about the repo (‚ÄúWhat does X function do?‚Äù ‚ÄúShow me auth logic‚Äù)
   - Semantic search finds and retrieves the most relevant code chunks
   - LLM (via LangChain) generates contextual, accurate answers using retrieved code
5. **Explore:**  
   - Hierarchical explorer shows real file tree, lets you preview content and metadata
   - Repo analytics panel for high-level insights
